#  1. Objective

    1. This document will help to understand various possible PowerBI operations and how it can be achieved using PowerShell and Rest APIâ€™s.
    2. Also covered pre-requisites, PowerShell dependencies to be included and Sample code for each of the PowerBI operations.
    3. This could be helpful to implement & maintain automated processes for PowerBI.
    4. Developer will be able to use Sample code provided. 

#  2. Prerequisites

#####  1. PowerBI On Prem Gateway
PowerBI on prem gateway will act as bridge between on prem database and PowerBI services. Refer below document attached herewith to set up On Prem gateway.

#### Power BI on-prem gateway.docs-

#####   2. PowerBI App registration to consume API
Go to https://dev.powerbi.com/apps and sign in. Click on Next to Register your application. Provide application name (Anything) and select application type as Native.

Select the APIs and the level of access your application needs. You can change these settings later in the Azure portal.
Once you are done with Application registration, you will get Client Id which is needed.

   # 3. Data Set Operations using PowerShell

#### 3.1 Get Dataset in Group

#### 3.3 Dataset Refresh  

Triggers a refresh for the specified dataset from "My Workspace".
In Shared capacities this call is limited to eight times per day (including refreshes executed via Scheduled Refresh).

In Premium capacities this call is not limited in number of times per day, but only by the available resources in the capacity, hence if overloaded, the refresh execution may be throttled until the load is reduced. If this throttling exceeds 1 hour, the refresh will fail.
